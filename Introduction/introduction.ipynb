    "1. **On basis of the nature of the learning “signal” or “feedback” available to a learning system**\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning:** The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs. The trainning process continues until the model achives the desired level of accuracy on the training data. Some real-life examples are:\n",
    "    * **Image Classification:** You train with images/labels. Then in the future you give a new image expecting that the computer will recognize the new object.\n",
    "    * **Market Prediction/Regression:** You train the computer with historical market data and ask the computer to predict the new price in the future.\n",
    "        \n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning:** No labels are given to the algorithm, leaving it on its owns to find structure in the input. It is used to Clustering population in different groups. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself(discovering hidden partterns in data).\n",
    "    * **Clustering:** You ask the computer to separete similar data into clusters, this essential in reasearch and science.\n",
    "    * **High Dimension Vision:** Use the computer to help us visualize high dimension data.\n",
    "    * **Generative Models:** After a model captures the probability distribution of yout input data, it will be able to generate more data. This can be very useful to make your classifier more robust.\n",
